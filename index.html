    <h1>I am just making a test page</h1>
    <h2>so that I can test out things on GitHub</h2>
    <p>I'm having a hard time understanding how to use GitHub and the Command Line so I've created these files to use as stand in's for learning how to use both better.</p>
    <p>I'm just adding basic styling so unfortunately this is not going to pass alot of accessibility tests.</p>
    <p> ....and if you find this, I hope you are having a great day and don't forget to pay it forward in kindness and patience!</p>
